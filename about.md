My name is **Laurel Dsouza**, and this is my blog. I am a Business Intelligence & Cloud Solutions Architect (MCITP, MCTS, CCNP, VCP) based in the DC Metro area.

I have a certificate in Data Science and Big Data Analytics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated with a Masterâ€™s Degree from George Mason University. My journey with SharePoint and SQL began as an administrator and from there I got more involved in design and building solutions as a developer and architect. 

I strive to build innovative solutions that merge technology with business and empower my clients to be more productive, efficient and make better decisions.

I spend my free time playing the guitar, reading, blogging and designing websites. I love swimming and playing sports like soccer, tennis and basketball. 

Keep an eye on my blog to get updated on real world IT solutions, tutorials and tips on BI, SharePoint, Dynamics 365, Office 365, Azure and related technologies. If you would like to connect with me, my social media profile links are at the bottom.
