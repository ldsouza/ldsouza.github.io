My name is **Laurel Dsouza**, and this is my blog. I am a Professional BI & Cloud Solutions Consultant (MCITP, MCTS, CCNP, VCP) based in the DC Metro area.

I graduated with a Masters Degree in Telecommunications from George Mason University and have been working on the Micrsoft Stack since 2008. My journey with SharePoint and SQL began as a administrator and from there I got more involved in design and building solutions as a developer. 

I strive to build innovative solutions that merge technology with business and empower my clients to be more productive, efficient and make better decisions.

I spend my free time playing the guitar, reading, blogging and designing websites. I love swimming and playing sports like soccer, tennis and basketball. 

Keep an eye on my blog to get updated on real world IT solutions, tutorials and tips on BI, SharePoint, Office 365, Azure and related technologies. If you would like to connect with me, my social media profile links are at the bottom.
