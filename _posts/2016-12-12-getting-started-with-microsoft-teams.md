### Creating Teams and Channels

Teams are collections of people surrounding different projects and jobs within an organization. Teams contain one or more channels which are open collaborative workspaces where members can share conversations, files and more. A Team Owner can create a team or add members to a team.

Channels keep team conversations organized and you can dedicate channels to specific topics, areas, projects or something fun. Anyone who is a member of the team can add channels. Private Channels are not available at the moment, so if you would like to chat and share files privately, create another team where you can restrict membership.


Cons
You have to mention a name or a team to notify them, when you start a new thread. There is no way to automatically notify a team.
External Access not available
Private Channels not supported

Pros
Integration with Office 365 Groups
Easy to work with files and collaborate using the chat window
