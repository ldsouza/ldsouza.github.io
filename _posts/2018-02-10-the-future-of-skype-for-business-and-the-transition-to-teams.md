Here is an example of how Microsoft envisions Teams will be a powerful tool that combines communications, collaboration, and intelligence.

Before a meeting, Teams will surface relevant documents and rich information about the participants to help you prepare.

During the meeting, the conversation can be captured, transcribed, and time-coded, with closed captioning and voice recognition for attributing remarks to specific individuals.

After the meeting, the cloud recording and transcript can be automatically added to the relevant channel, so conversations, documents, notes, and action items can be reviewed, indexed, and searched by the entire team.

This is very exciting news and gives organization some clarity on investing in Microsoft Teams as the choice of communication and collaboration tool in Office 365.

Here is some good discussion on the impact this will have on Skype for Business server onpremises and other considerations.
