Microsoft announced their plan for the future of intelligent communication at the Ignite Conference last year. The big announcement was that Microsoft Teams would be the primary client for intelligent communications in Office 365, replacing the current Skype for Business client over time.

This transition involves bringing the capabilities of Skype for Business like calling and meetings into Microsoft Teams.

To learn more about Mirosoft Teams and to get started with Microsoft Teams, here is a blog post I had written earlier on the subject.

## The Future of Teams

Here is an example, of how Microsoft, envisions Teams will be a powerful tool that combines communications, collaboration, and intelligence.

Before a meeting, Teams will surface relevant documents and rich information about the participants to help you prepare.

During the meeting, the conversation can be captured, transcribed, and time-coded, with closed captioning and voice recognition for attributing remarks to specific individuals.

After the meeting, the cloud recording and transcript can be automatically added to the relevant channel, so conversations, documents, notes, and action items can be reviewed, indexed, and searched by the entire team.

This is very exciting news and gives organization some clarity on investing in Microsoft Teams as the choice of communication and collaboration tool in Office 365.

## Is this the end for Skype for Business

Here is some good discussion on the impact this decision will have on Skype for Business server on-premises and other considerations.
