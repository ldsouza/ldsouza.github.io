## What is Power BI

Power BI is Microsoft's suite of business analytics tools that is cloud-based. It is the evolution of the Microsoft BI Stack beginning from on premises solutions like SSRS and SharePoint to a cloud based data analytics service like Power BI.

##  Power BI Desktop vs Browser
Authors can create reports using Power BI Desktop or the browser. Power BI Desktop is a powerful data exploration and reporting tool that can be installed on your computer. It allows you to drap and drop visualizations onto the report canvas and allows you to publish reports to the cloud through the Power BI Service. Power BI Desktop can be used to create dashboards.

The browser can be used to build reports and dashboards, but there is no data modeling functionality in the browser. We also can create relationships and model data using DAX in Power BI Desktop, but not in the browser.

Once a report is created in Power BI desktop, it can be published to the Power BI Service, where consumers can access the report or a dashbaord on either a Browser, Ipad, Iphone, Android, Windows 10 phone app.

## Power BI Concepts

Here are few concepts that you should be aware of, before you start creating reports.

Visual
A Visual or Visualization is a Chart, Table, Matrix or KPI that you can add to the report canvas. Custom Visuals created by Third Party vendors extend the capacilites of Power BI and are a powerful addition to Power BI's feature set.

Report
A Report is a collection of pages that contain visuals. The Report Visuals can be pinned to a Dashboard.

Dashboard
A Dashboard is a consolidated view of reports. You can drill down into a report from a Dashboard.

Workspaces
Any report or Dashboard you create is saved to your personal workspace. To share reports and dashboards with a group of people, you can create a group workspace and add the report or dashboard to the workspace to begin collaborating with other members in the group.

DataSet
A DataSet is a datamodel that can contain one or more tables. You can do a manual refresh or schedule a refresh of a Dataset.

Power BI has a rich set of functionalities and capacilites that complete with Tableau and other Self Service Analytics Tools. The Power BI team releases new features every month.
