## What is Power BI

Power BI is Microsoft's cloud-based analytics service that is subscription based. It is the evolution of the Microsoft BI Stack beginning from on premises solutions like SSRS and SharePoint to a cloud based data analytics service like Power BI. 

It is easy to get started with Power BI and begin creating reports in a matter of minutes. You can sign up for a free account here at https://app.powerbi.com. You do not need an Office 365 subscription or SharePoint Online to begin using Power BI.

## Power BI vs Power BI Pro
There is a paid version of Power BI called Power BI Pro that has more features like higher data capacity limits and more frequent refresh intervals. To find out more on the differences between Power BI Pro and free accounts - https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/

Reports and Dashboards can be created in Power BI by using either Power BI Desktop or the Browser.

##  Power BI Authors and Consumers
Authors can reports using either the Power BI Desktop or the browser. The browser can be used to build reports and dashboards, but there is no data modeling functionality in the browser. We also can create relationships and model data using DAX in Power BI Desktop, but not in the browser. Once a report is created in Power BI desktop, it can be published to the Power BI Service, where consumers can access the report or a dashbaord on either a Browser, Ipad, Iphone, Android, Windows 10 phone app.
