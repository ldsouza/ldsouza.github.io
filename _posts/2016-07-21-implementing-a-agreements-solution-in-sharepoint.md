title: Implementing a Agreements Solution in SharePoint
tags: SharePoint
---
In this post, I will share an excellent solution demonstrated by Peter Kalmstr√∂m from Kalmstrom Solutionshttp://kalmstrom.com/ to store Rental Agreements in SharePoint. 

You can use the concepts you learn here, to build your own business solution. In this particular solution, we would like to store Rental Agreements for warehouses and stores in two separate lists. 

Some of the concepts and techniques covered are:-

*Creating a Content Type
*Creating Site Columns
*Creating Workflows
   -Send Formatted Emails
