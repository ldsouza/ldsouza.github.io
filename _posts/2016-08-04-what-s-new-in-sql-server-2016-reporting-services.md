SQL Server Reporting Services traditionally has been used for creating paginated reports. Paginated reports are formatted for printing and are reports you can export and email. Paginated Reports is just one of the type of reports today that companies use in their BI workloads. But in modern times, users are demanding reports that are accessible from mobile devices like phones and tablets and a modern data visualization experience. 

In 2015, Microsoft acquired Datazen, an industry leader in mobile business intelligence and data visualization on Windows, iOS and Android devices. This acquisition paved the way for some of the most exciting changes in SSRS that we will go over in this post.
