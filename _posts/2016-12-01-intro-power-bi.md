## What is Power BI

##  Power BI Desktop vs Browser
Authors can create reports using Power BI Desktop or the browser. Power BI Desktop is a powerful data exploration and reporting tool that can be installed on your computer. It allows you to drap and drop visualizations onto the report canvas and allows you to publish reports to the cloud through the Power BI Service. Power BI Desktop can be used to create dashboards.

The browser can be used to build reports and dashboards, but there is no data modeling functionality in the browser. We also can create relationships and model data using DAX in Power BI Desktop, but not in the browser.

## Power BI Concepts

Here are few concepts that you should be aware of, before you start creating reports.

##### Visual 
A Power BI Visual or Visualization allows you to interact with data to find business insights. Some examples of data visuals are charts, tables, matrices and KPI's  Custom Visuals created by third Party vendors extend the capacilites of Power BI and are a powerful addition to Power BI's feature set.

##### Report 
A Power BI report is one or more pages of visualizations (charts, graphs and images). Report Visuals can be pinned to a dashboard. 

##### Dashboard 
A Dashboard is a consolidated view of reports from different datasets.

##### Workspace  
Any report or Dashboard you create is saved to your personal workspace. To share reports and dashboards with a group of people, you can create a group workspace and add the report or dashboard to the workspace to begin collaborating with other members in the group.
