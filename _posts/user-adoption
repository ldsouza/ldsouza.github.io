 Useful Tips 


 
Sometimes it does not work -



Building a Better Intranet -2

***Focus on Users

Make it user centered - Allow users to be the content creators

Defind why - what are your goals - why are you using instanet - document managment - social collaboration

Dont Build an intranet for the sake of building an intranet

Build a Bridge ***
An Intranet is a bridge between the employees and an organization. You want to bring people together, share ideas and get work done quicker.

We want to connect employees to each other and the organization. You get engagement and adoption.

Do you have formal user adoption plan? You can train them all and teach them, but if people don;t know why they are not goign to use it.

Define your why****
The secret to better adoption and change management is why do I need to use it this way versus another.

Measure and Act ****
How do you measure usage? Make it measurable. Undersstand how we are doing, should we make changes or go back to the drawing board.

***LUCK - Listen - Understand - Comnnect Know

1) Are we Listening? Are we connecting users to the Organization?
2) What % of your organization use mobile, are millenials? Know how your users work? What do your users value?
3) Create ambassadors, champions, evangelists, advocates to spread the message? When you get people involved, they will support what they helped create.

Look at how the most productive, and innovate employees are using and adopting technology? Are they using our tools? What are they using?



*** Organizate Content and Navitation for useres -- Allow users to easily find what they are looking for, Lots of organization have poor directions.


 Tips -
 * MEga Menus (rathers than many top leel items, add few action-oriented menu items with many drill down options.)
 * Action Oriented Labels (instead of what it is, to what the user wants to do)

Isntead of Mileage Claims -> Get Paid
Isntead of Support -> Contact Helpdesk for Immediate Support

* Rethink communication
 - Prepare (Dont assume everyone is an early adopter, deliver just-in-time, bite sized help when it comes tro training, start early and repeat regularly)
 - New way of training (shift from courses to resources), new employees missed training,
 - 
 Process (regular webinars, lunch and learns)

44% employees say that inssufficient training is a barrier. People dont care if they dont know why.

Tip 5 * Less is More. so much digital noise, meetings, alerts and notifications on phone, emails and texts
Minimize content, clicks, it becomes information overload.

ATtention Span (the 3 -second rule) - Users have to know within few seconds where to go
Bite Sized Delivery - Give me little bit and more later.
Consitency ius key - familiar = findable  (make sure your sites, page to page look the same and are consistent, reducnes confusion and frustration)

Tip 6 ** Manage your ROT (REdundant, Outdated and Trivial) - Decaying your intranet
No longer useful and has been replaces, uninmoortant and adds no additional value, unecessary and often duplicate

Tip 7 - Give users a voice
engaging users - After going live - common response send support request
No one is going to send feedback using helpdesk   -Feedback solution (Visual SP)

Tip 8 - Loosen Up (Balanced view on governance)
- Flexible with the edges (Collaboration, team and project sites, one drive, check incheck, personal views)
- Rigid at the Core (Corporate metadata, Intranet Home page content, published articles, retention policies)
- 

Tip 9 - Keep one hand on the wheel
Once you go live, always keep one hand on the wheel, an intranet is meant to change
Get Feedback, understand what people are strugllging with, Have a multi department steering committe

There is a 30% increase in  project success when a collaborating project includes a multi departmentatl steeting commitee.

Every quarter ask your eusers for three things you should start doing and three things you should stop doing.


Tip 10 - thin Evolution, not revolution.
Follw your plan, step by


Why some users dont want to tag? There is a huge cultureeal to change? Maybe our culture is not just this way. Dont fight your culture

Think different (put some rules on folders).
