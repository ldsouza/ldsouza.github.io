### Why should you use OneNote?
OneNote is a collaborative notetaking app that helps you get organized and work better as a team. You could use it as a collaboration space for your teams or an area to share important resources, links and policies with your team. You could use it for user specific projects, taking meeting notes or tracking sales progress.

###### Provides a Collaborative Experience
Notebooks can be shared with people inside or outside your organization. When a team member makes changes to the notebook, their name will show up beside it so you can easily track changes.

### Tips before getting started with OneNote

When you create notebooks, try to stay consistent. You could create a separate notebook for user projects and  a separate notebook for work meeting notes.

It is recommended to save your notebooks to a cloud location, so you donâ€™t lose your
work if your computer crashes. I prefer saving my notebooks to my One Drive.

You can integrate OneNote with Outlook by clicking the Meeting Notes Icon in your outlook calendar to take notes for a particular meeting.

Use a template to help you get started with OneNote. Once you get more familiar with OneNote, you can add your own templates.
