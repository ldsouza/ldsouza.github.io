### Tips before getting started with OneNote


You have several options where you can save your OneNote notebooks like saving to a SharePoint Account, One Drive account or your local device. It is recommended to save your notebooks to a cloud location, so you donâ€™t lose your work if your computer crashes.

You can Integrate OneNote with Outlook. Click the Meeting Notes Icon in your outlook calendar to take notes for a particular meeting.

Use a template to help you get started. Once you get more familiar with OneNote, you can add your own templates.

When creating Notebooks, you could create notebooks for anything from user projects to meeting notes. The goal is to make it consistent. You can add sections in a notebook and pages in a section.
