Nintex Forms is an excellent alternative to InfoPath forms for building forms in SharePoint. Niintex Forms has a clean, drag and drop intuitive form builder interface which should allow power users and developers to build forms with ease.

Features that I liked in Nintex Forms -

Form Controls
There are several form controls that are extremely useful in building your form solution like Panel, Repeating Section, Label, SharePoint List Lookup.

SharePoint Columns
Create Column from within the form builder and saves you time from going to back to SharePoint to create columns. 

Rules

Custom Css (Form Settings)

Form Controls (Panel, Repeating Section, Label, SharePoint List Lookup)

Import and Export Form

Design Mobile Forms

Set Rule on each control/panel

Enable or Set visibility of each control

Restrict controls to certain group of users

Cons

Cannot copy and paste controls into a panel or repeating section

No option to save and leave form open.

If you do create columns in SharePoint, there is no way to refresh the form to pick up the columns. You would have to close out the form builder and re-open.
