title: Nintex Forms for Office 365 - An Overview
---
Nintex Forms is an excellent alternative to InfoPath for building forms in SharePoint. Nintex Forms has an intuitive drag and drop form builder interface which allows power users and developers to build forms with ease.

### Features that I liked in Nintex Forms -

-Form Controls:
There are several form controls like Panel, Repeating Section, Label, SharePoint List Lookup that are extremely useful in building your form solution .

-SharePoint Columns:
Create a column from within the form builder and use them in your form. This saves you the effort of going to back to SharePoint to create columns. 

-Rules:
This is a powerful feature that allows you to set rules on controls that you add to a form. Some rules that you can set are setting the visibility or enabling controls based on other named controls. To set a rule on mutiple controls, add the controls to a panel control and apply the rule to the panel.

-Print to Pdf
Print to Pdf is a feature available in the Enterprise version. This setting allows you to print the form contents.

Custom Css (Form Settings)


Import and Export Form

Design Mobile Forms


Restrict controls to certain group of users

Cons

Cannot copy and paste controls into a panel or repeating section

No option to save and leave form open.

If you do create columns in SharePoint, there is no way to refresh the form to pick up the columns. You would have to close out the form builder and re-open.
