title: Nintex Forms for Office 365 - An Overview
---
Nintex Forms is an excellent alternative to InfoPath for building forms in SharePoint. Niintex Forms has an intuitive drag and drop form builder interface which should allow power users and developers to build forms with ease.

### Features that I liked in Nintex Forms -

-Form Controls

There are several form controls like Panel, Repeating Section, Label, SharePoint List Lookup that are extremely useful in building your form solution .

-SharePoint Columns
Create a column from within the form builder and use them in your form. This saves you the effort of going to back to SharePoint to create columns. 

-Rules

Custom Css (Form Settings)


Import and Export Form

Design Mobile Forms

Set Rule on each control/panel

Enable or Set visibility of each control

Restrict controls to certain group of users

Cons

Cannot copy and paste controls into a panel or repeating section

No option to save and leave form open.

If you do create columns in SharePoint, there is no way to refresh the form to pick up the columns. You would have to close out the form builder and re-open.
